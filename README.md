Mpox, previously known as monkeypox, is a zoonotic virus belonging to the Orthopoxvirus 
genus, closely related to smallpox. Although it was once endemic to Central and West Africa, 
the global spread of Mpox has surged since 2022. As of September 2024, the World Health 
Organization (WHO) reported 109,699 confirmed cases and 236 deaths across 123 countries, 
reflecting a widely varying case fatality rate that is influenced by healthcare access and 
population vulnerabilities.Our study investigated multiple CNN architectures, including ResNet152, DenseNet169, 
EfficientNetB7, and VGG16, trained on the Mpox Skin Lesion Dataset (MSLD v2.0). This 
dataset, curated to encompass a diverse array of skin lesion images, provides a robust
foundation for developing models capable of distinguishing Mpox from other similar viral 
infections. Among the architectures assessed, ResNet152 and DenseNet169 achieved a 
classification accuracy of more than 90%, substantially surpassing other models, which 
ranged from 80% to 85%. The layered residual connections inherent in ResNet152 likely 
contributed to this superior performance, mitigating the vanishing gradient issues commonly 
encountered in deep networks. Renowned for its depth and capacity to capture complex 
hierarchical features, this architecture proved exceptionally proficient in lesion classification 
tasks, In DenseNet169, the dense connectivity or dense connections between layers is the 
primary architectural feature that contributes to its superior performance
